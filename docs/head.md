# equal

Check if two values are equivalent. This is a deep equivalence check so if an object has other objects on it properties they must also be equivalent in order for the overall comparison to hold. 

## Getting Started

With component(1) 

`component install jkroso/equal`

In Node.js 

`npm install jkroso/equal`

A pre-built browser version is also [available](https://raw.github.com/jkroso/equal/master/dist/equal.js). It exports the global variable equal. 

## API

```javascript
var equal = require('equal')
```
