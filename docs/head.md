# equals

Check if two values are equivalent. This is a deep equivalence check so if an object has other objects on it properties they must also be equivalent in order for the overall comparison to hold. 

## Getting Started

With component(1) 

`component install jkroso/equals --save`

In Node.js 

`npm install equals --save`

A pre-built browser version is also [available](https://raw.github.com/jkroso/equals/master/dist/equals.js). It exports the global variable equal. 

## API

```javascript
var equal = require('equals')
```
